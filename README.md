# personCounter

Famous places like monuments, religious shrines, concerts etc. face high footfall on special occasions. Unfortunate circumstances can cause stampedes or structural damages due to overload.

It is not possible to predict the inflow every time. So, an automated regulatory mechanism is necessary to monitor the count. And if the count is more than the limit, authorities must be intimated to take necessary action. This alert can also be made visible to the newcomers so that they can become cautious and wait till the place is less crowded.

Experts can decide on a threshold safety limit for the respective place. The limit is the maximum number of people the venue can sustain without damaging the structure. It is also determined based on its available exit facilities which can allow them to leave safely in case of any emergency.

The technology of Computer Vision could be useful to find a potential solution to this problem. Nowadays most public spaces are under surveillance by CCTV cameras for security purposes and they are often connected to a computer for storing and monitoring. This tool can run on these computers (with some upgrades, if necessary) and track the peopleâ€™s counts using the live feed from the CCTV cameras. A central hub then takes input from all exits/entries and calculates the final count.

An application like this alone does not guarantee safety, however, it can play a major role in ensuring it.
